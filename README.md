## Problem 1

### Getting running locally
- This is a basic HTML/ CSS app. To see it locally on your machine, simply clone or fork this repo. For a step by step on how to for a repo, see this link: [click me](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

### Approach
- Instructions specified to make this app using only HTML and CSS (non-interactive), so I used a basic table with static HTML for each todo item.

### Resources
- I relied heavily on Bootstrap documentation to recall the correct classes to use for making a table using Bootstrap. [link to bootstrap tables](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/tables/)
- I used google fonts to make the header font and table titles more aesthetically pleasing

### Next Steps
- I would really like to spend much more time styling this, I have a lot of great ideas from building past todo apps :)
- I would want to make the app interactive using JavaScript. I would ideally like to do this using Angular. More specifically, UI-Router. Having multiple pages to organize the app makes sense to me. Using state provider would allow me to break up my code into reusable pieces. Angular also makes it very convenient to list items (such as todo's), which is why I would use this framework.
